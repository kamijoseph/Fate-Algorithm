If you have surfed through My GitHub you may have come across my Fate Program Repository. This is the same but I am rebuilding every part of it, improving restructuring. 
I know you may be asking yourself why not update this newer version to the old into this new program and the answers are:


  --> The older version reminds me of the best times, the old times I wrote a comprehensive project.
  
  --> This is a comparison of how far I have come and grown as a Python developer.
  
  --> And finally, because these are my repositories, I do what I want with them.

Will there be another one after this? Absolutely No. When I feel like this needs changes or a complete makeover, i will just update it on here. Anyways your contribution are welcome
, you may add but don't subtract, make the uderlying code better. Suitable for beginners and other programmers of all levels
