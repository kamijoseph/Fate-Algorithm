## HOW TO RUN

## REMARKS --> PLEASE READ FREN
1. On the math_challenge.py module you can change the MAX_OPERAND value to increase the difficulty of the Program,
and the TOTAL_PROBLEMS value to add more questions. If you are a contributor reading this you cn add that functionality
where the program prompts an user input for those values, that is if you are the earliest person to discover this part.
i am leaving that to you.Ps: i will not be updating this part of the readme if someone adds the functionaity but i will accept their code input and update that.

If you have surfed through My GitHub you may have come across my Fate Program Repository. This is the same but I am rebuilding every part of it, improving restructuring. 
I know you may be asking yourself why not update this newer version to the old into this new program and the answers are:


  --> The older version reminds me of the best times, the old times I wrote a comprehensive project.
  
  --> This is a comparison of how far I have come and grown as a Python developer.
  
  --> And finally, because these are my repositories, I do what I want with them.

Will there be another one after this? Absolutely No. When I feel like this needs changes or a complete makeover, i will just update it on here. Anyways your contribution are welcome
, you may add but don't subtract, make the uderlying code better. Suitable for beginners and other programmers of all levels

BYE LET'S GET TO WORK>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
