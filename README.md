# HOW TO RUN
## Main.py File
Run Main.py File to run the Program. 
The file imports all other files in the code as modules and respectively calls their main function where needed.

## The Modules.
All other files are imported as modules and their main function called to run the respective tasks meant..........
Although, they are called in the main.py each single file is ready to be used and run, so just open your file of choice and run the code, but thats a degenerative way to run it. ðŸ˜‚

## REMARKS --> PLEASE READ FREN
1. On the math_challenge.py module you can change the MAX_OPERAND value to increase the difficulty of the Program,
and the TOTAL_PROBLEMS value to add more questions. If you are a contributor reading this you can add that functionality
where the program prompts a user input for those values, that is if you are the earliest person to discover this part.
i am leaving that to you. Ps: i will not be updating this part of the readme if someone adds the functionality but i will accept their code input and update that.

If you have surfed through My GitHub you may have come across my Fate Program Repository. This is the same but I am rebuilding every part of it, improving restructuring. 
I know you may be asking yourself why not update this newer version to the old into this new program and the answers are:


  --> The older version reminds me of the best times, the old times I wrote a comprehensive project.
  
  --> This is a comparison of how far I have come and grown as a Python developer.
  
  --> And finally, because these are my repositories, I do what I want with them.

Will there be another one after this? Absolutely No. When I feel like this needs changes or a complete makeover, i will just update it on here. Anyways your contributions are welcome
, you may add but don't subtract, make the underlying code better. Suitable for beginners and other programmers of all levels

BYE LET'S GET TO WORK>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
